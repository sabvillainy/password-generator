# Password Generator Project
This project is a password generator program written in C# for my "Essentials of Programming" course. The program generates random passwords based on specific criteria and outputs the results with a delay. Below are the project instructions that my lecturer indicated:

# Project Requirements
1. Password Composition:

- The password should be composed of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters (?, *, _, -).

2. Password Length:

- The password should be between a minimum of 6 characters and a maximum of 12 characters.
- The length of the password is determined randomly by the computer.

3. Output Format:

- The generated characters are displayed one by one on the screen with a delay of 1 second between each character.
- After the entire password is generated, the complete password is displayed on the screen.

4. Password Strength:

- If the password length is greater than or equal to 10 characters, the output message should state "A strong password has been generated".
- If the password length is 8 or 9 characters, the output message should state "A medium-strength password has been generated".
- If the password length is less than 8 characters, the output message should state "A weak password has been generated".

5. Startup Message:

- When the program starts, it should display the message "Your password is being generated..." and begin generating the password after a delay of 5 seconds.

# Key Points
- This project is part of my coursework, and originality is crucial. Plagiarism or using pre-existing online code will significantly affect my grade.
- The program is implemented in C#.
- The random password generation and timed character display demonstrate the application of fundamental programming concepts such as random number generation, loops, and timed delays.
